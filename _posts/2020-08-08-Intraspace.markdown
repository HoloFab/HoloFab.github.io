[Intraspace](http://www.iaacblog.com/programs/intraspace/) is a master project in [Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia](https://iaac.net/) that served as one of the prototypes for the Holofab project. Intraspace comes on the intersection of current states of Augmented Reality and Internet of Things proposing a smarter and more informed way for us to utilize resources and potential of interior spaces.

Big Data is gradually coming to a point where the **density of data** is high enough to provide informative and meaningful insights over the use of space or over minute environmental conditions inside, - thanks to slow but steady growth of Internet of Things.

On the other hand, Augmented and Mixed Reality technology slowly exits experimental prototype stage and grows from one-off devices into an **immersive and extensive experiences**, while gradually improving ergonomically. This provides opportunity to have space itself as a canvas, extending the power of digital information communication techniques to a more **natural and accessible medium**.

As a result of the research, project proposes a working prototype of a system with complete coverage of the **extended space-use flow**: from the data collection, processing with Machine Learning techniques, to a system of informed space evaluation, to a communication system keeping the user in the loop in decision-making process, as well as proving a way to close this loop by participating in otherwise closed off and isolated systems and algorithms, thus democratizing the whole process.

The project envisions a day when spaces become so complex and the digital systems so blended, that the use of Augmented Reality would not just be a entertainment factor or a pure visualization technique, but rather a necessary and immersive way to shape the space around you. The strategic position of AR on the spectrum of Mixed Reality makes it extremely powerful by benefitting in the most balanced way from both the physical and the digital - thus serving as a **common language** between the two.

This research and the **functional prototype** in parts became a starting point when merged with [Cyber-Physical Construction](http://www.iaacblog.com/programs/cyber-physical-construction/) - master thesis project from Armin Akbari.
